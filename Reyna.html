		<p> Reyna has 4 abilities that can be used to blind enemies and help her team get onto site. Most of her abilities is kill-based, so if you don't get a kill, then the ability is useless, but because of that, a lot of people like to play Reyna because of her selfish abilities which heals her and lets her get away from fights. </p>
