		<h2 id = "f"> Role </h2>
		<p> Astra's role is Controller. </p>
		<hr>
		<h2 id = "a"> Abilities </h2>
		<p>Like all agents in Valorant, Astra has 4 abilities. To use her abilities, you would have to go in Astral Form (Press X) and place down Stars around the map and you can turn the Stars into different abilities, so this agent is pretty hard to play compared to others because you would have to make plays beforehand, so you would have to anticipate different situations.</p>

		<h2 id ="c"> Nebula </h2>
		<p>Astra's second ability is Nebula. Activate a Star to transform it into a Nebula (smoke). You can use F on a Star to dissipate it.</p>

		<h2 id="d"> Gravity Well </h2>
		<p> Astra's third ability is Gravity Well. Activate a Star to form a Gravity well. Players (including your teammates) in the area are pulled towards the center before it explodes, making all the players still trapped inside fragile.</p>

		<hr>
		<h2 id="e"> Astra Form/Cosmic Divide </h2>
		<p>This is Astra's ultimate and also how you place down stars. When you press X, you will enter Astral Form where you can place Stars by pressing the primary fire button (left-click unless you changed it). When Cosmic Divide is charged, use Secondary Fire in Astra Form to begin aiming it, then primary fire to select two locations. An infinite Cosmic Divide connects the two points you select and Cosmic Divide blocks bullets and heavily dampens the audio.</p>
